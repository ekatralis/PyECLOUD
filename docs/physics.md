# Physical models and numerical algorithms

These references describe the physics and numerical methods underlying
PyECLOUD. They were collected in the original
[physics wiki page](https://github.com/PyCOMPLETE/PyECLOUD/wiki/Physical-models-and-numerical-algorithms).
The older presentations document the implementation at the time they were
written; use the current parameter reference for configuration syntax.
