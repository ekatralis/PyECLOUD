# Buildup simulation outputs

The main output is a MATLAB `.mat` file, named `Pyecltest.mat` by default.
`filen_main_outp` selects another name. Multiple-cloud simulations write an
output file for each cloud. This page covers the buildup output; single-bunch
beam monitors use HDF5 files as shown in the
[single-bunch tutorial](../tutorials/single-bunch.md).

## Read a result

```python
from scipy.io import loadmat

data = loadmat("Pyecltest.mat", squeeze_me=True)
print(sorted(name for name in data if not name.startswith("__")))
print(data["t"].shape, data["Nel_timep"].shape)
```

`squeeze_me=True` removes singleton dimensions. Inspect shapes before indexing
histograms, especially for runs with only one sample or bunch passage.
The [buildup tutorial](../tutorials/buildup.md#inspect-your-result) plots the
time series from an actual run.

## Time series

Use the saved `t` array as the time coordinate. The saver uses a sampling
interval based on `Dt_ref * dec_fact_out`; saving and tracking need not occur
at the same cadence. Entries for emitted and impacting electrons accumulate
over the interval since the previous saved sample.

PyECLOUD represents a transverse section. Electron population sums are
normalized per unit longitudinal length, not counts integrated over a whole
magnet. Weighted electron energies likewise carry that longitudinal
normalization. Central and probe densities divide by the transverse sampling
area to give volume density.

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `t` | Saved simulation times [s]; one value per recorded sample |
| `lam_t_array` | Beam line density [particles/m] at those times |
| `Nel_timep` | Electron population in the chamber [electrons/m] |
| `Nel_emit_time` | Electrons emitted during the saved interval, per metre |
| `Nel_imp_time` | Electrons impacting during the saved interval, per metre |
| `En_emit_eV_time` | Weighted emitted-electron energy during the interval [eV/m] |
| `En_imp_eV_time` | Weighted impacting-electron energy during the interval [eV/m] |
| `En_kin_eV_time` | Total weighted electron kinetic energy currently in the chamber [eV/m] |
| `cen_density` | Electron volume density in a transverse disk of radius `r_center` around the origin [m⁻³] |

These time-series arrays share the saved sample index. Optional time-series
fields include `N_mp_time` and `nel_mp_ref_time` when `flag_detailed_MP_info`
is enabled. Other enabled models can add fields, such as electric-field energy
or cross-ionization observables.

## Bunch passages and histograms

`t_hist` indexes bunch-passage records and `xg_hist` gives horizontal bin
coordinates. Horizontal histograms are organized by passage and horizontal
bin. Energy spectra use their own recorded times, `t_En_hist`, and energy-bin
coordinates, `En_g_hist`; do not assume their number of records equals the
number of bunch passages.

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `t_hist` | Times associated with bunch-passage records [s] |
| `xg_hist` | Horizontal histogram coordinates [m] |
| `N_mp_pass` | Number of macroparticles in the chamber at each passage |
| `N_mp_ref_pass` | Reference macroparticle weight at each passage |
| `N_mp_impact_pass` | Number of macroparticle impacts during each passage |
| `N_mp_corrected_pass` | Number of macroparticle tracking corrections during each passage |
| `nel_hist` | Horizontal histogram of the electron population |
| `nel_impact_hist_tot` | Horizontal histogram of electron impacts |
| `nel_impact_hist_scrub` | Horizontal impact histogram restricted to energies above `scrub_en_th` |
| `energ_eV_impact_hist` | Horizontal histogram of weighted energy deposited at the walls |
| `En_hist` | Impacting-electron energy spectrum |
| `all_Ekin_hist` | Energy histogram of the electrons in the chamber |
| `t_En_hist` | Times associated with the energy spectra [s] |
| `En_g_hist` | Energy-bin centres [eV] |
| `lifetime_hist` | Electron lifetime histogram, when enabled |
| `lifetime_g_hist` | Lifetime-bin centres [s] |

The energy and lifetime histograms include overflow in their final bin. Counts
are binned accumulations; converting them into a density per unit energy or
time requires the corresponding bin width and accumulation interval.

## Other and optional fields

Some fields are absent when their feature is disabled; others may contain an
empty array or a sentinel value. Inspect the saved data before plotting them.

{download}`the original manual <../../doc/reference/reference.pdf>` by
Giovanni Iadarola, Eleonora Belli, Philipp Dijkstal, Lotta Mether, Annalisa Romano,
Giovanni Rumolo, and Eric Wulff. Field names were checked against
`PyECLOUD/pyecloud_saver.py`, including `xg_hist_det` (duplicated as `nel_hist_det`
in the old manual). Model-specific fields are not exhaustively listed here.
