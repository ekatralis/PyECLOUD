# HTCondor at CERN

Submit buildup scans and single-bunch stability simulations to CERN HTCondor
using the examples below. Replace the example EOS locations,
environment activation script, resources, and simulation inputs before use.

## Where files live

For the standard CERN batch setup:

| Location | Use in these examples |
| --- | --- |
| AFS, mounted on submit, scheduler, and worker nodes | Submit descriptions, executable scripts, DAG files, scheduler logs |
| EOS, mounted on submit and worker nodes, but not the standard scheduler nodes | Simulation inputs, results, and optionally the Python environment |
| Worker scratch (`_CONDOR_SCRATCH_DIR`) | Running the simulation and producing local output |

Submit from an AFS directory and keep submission files and scheduler logs there.
Workers can access EOS directly. For HTCondor-managed EOS transfers, use
`root://` URLs with the CERN XRootD transfer plugin, or run `xrdcp` inside
the worker to handle transfers yourself.
See the [CERN batch documentation](https://batchdocs.web.cern.ch/) for more details about HTCondor submissions.

### EOS paths and XRootD endpoints

The examples use `/eos/project/e/ecloud-simulations/YOURDIRECTORY/`.
Replace `YOURDIRECTORY` with your directory within the project.

Choose the XRootD endpoint to match the EOS storage you are using:

| Storage | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| EOS user space | `root://eosuser.cern.ch` |
| EOS project space | `root://eosproject-{initial project letter}.cern.ch` |

For the `ecloud-simulations` project, the initial letter is `e`, so the endpoint
is `root://eosproject-e.cern.ch`. A complete file URL looks like:

```text
root://eosproject-e.cern.ch//eos/project/e/ecloud-simulations/YOURDIRECTORY/scan/jobfiles.tgz
```

For user storage, use `root://eosuser.cern.ch` with your `/eos/user/...` path.
Update both the endpoint and the path when switching storage. In the stability
worker script these are `ROOT_URL` and `SIM_PATH`; keep their trailing slashes
as shown so the combined URL has `//eos/` after the hostname.

## Python environment

For the default examples, install the **complete Python/Conda environment on
EOS**, including its interpreter, packages, and activation scripts. Workers
activate the environment by sourcing:

```bash
source /eos/project/e/ecloud-simulations/YOURDIRECTORY/environments/activate-ecloud.sh
python -c 'import PyECLOUD, PyPARIS'
```

Create this script to activate your EOS-hosted virtualenv or Conda environment.
For Conda, source the EOS-hosted installation's `conda.sh` before activating
the environment by its EOS path. Use an environment compatible with the
worker OS. Follow the
[installation instructions](../installation.md) when preparing it.

### Alternative: a CVMFS container

We recommend `ghcr.io/ekatralis/ecloud-containers:latest`, maintained for
electron cloud simulations and available through CERN CVMFS. This avoids
maintaining your own Python environment on EOS.
Replace environment activation and the Python invocation with a wrapper such as:

```bash
run_python() {
    apptainer exec --cleanenv --env PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 \
        --home "$_CONDOR_SCRATCH_DIR" --pwd "$PWD" \
        /cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/ghcr.io/ekatralis/ecloud-containers:latest/ \
        python "$@"
}
run_python run_sim.py
```

The `latest` image evolves; record `ECLOUD_CONTAINER_VERSION` from inside the
container with your run and keep the software environment consistent across
continuation jobs. Check
the scratch-directory bindings for your image/site configuration. Run EOS
transfers from the host worker shell, where its credentials and XRootD tools
are available.

## Output transfers and held jobs

Configure output transfers in the **HTCondor submit file** (`htcondor.sub`).
For the `root://` destinations used here, explicitly list individual files in
the submit file's `transfer_output_files`. Do not use wildcards or rely on directory transfer via
this plugin. Archive a directory into one named file, or transfer its files
yourself from the worker.

**Every file listed in `transfer_output_files` must exist when output transfer
runs.** A missing file causes a transfer error and can put the job on hold,
making it appear stuck after the calculation finishes. This is why the buildup
example lists one archive and creates a diagnostic version before starting.
Check the exit code and logs even if the archive was transferred successfully.

With `transfer_output_files = ""`, the worker is responsible for saving the
simulation data. HTCondor still transfers standard output and error to the
locations specified by `output` and `error`.
`when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT` does not recover outputs on eviction or
removal. See the [HTCondor file-transfer manual](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-manual/file-transfer.html).

Inspect held jobs with `condor_q -hold` and the job's `HoldReason` before
releasing them. Check both the simulation exit status and transfer success.
Start with one short job before submitting a scan or a long continuation chain.
