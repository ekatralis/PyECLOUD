# Stability simulations with continuation

For single-bunch PyPARIS simulations, use a DAGMan node that runs one part at
a time. The worker script downloads the inputs and last completed state, runs
one simulation part, and uploads its checkpoint. Read the
[storage and environment setup](index.md) first.

## Configure simulation parts

In `Simulation_parameters.py`, for example:

```python
N_turns = 100
N_turns_target = 1000
check_for_resubmit = True
submission_system = 'HTCondor'
resubmit_command = None
```

Choose each part to finish comfortably within the job time limit, including
input and output transfers. PyPARIS returns `177` when a completed part needs
continuation. A normal final exit is `0`; inspect the simulation logs to
distinguish reaching the target from an intentional early stop. Other codes
represent failures. See [saving and restarting](../tutorials/restart.md).

## Submit description

Save as `htcondor.sub`. Keep this file, `pyparis_executable.sh`, the POST
script, DAG, and `logs/` on AFS. Put the simulation parameters and
`pyecloud_config` in an existing EOS run directory. This example transfers
`LHC_chm_ver.mat` separately; replace its URL with your geometry file and make
sure the simulation configuration refers to the transferred filename.

```text
universe = vanilla
executable = pyparis_executable.sh
arguments = $(request_cpus)
output = logs/$(ClusterId).$(ProcId).out
error = logs/$(ClusterId).$(ProcId).err
log = logs/$(ClusterId).log
should_transfer_files = YES
transfer_input_files = root://eosproject-e.cern.ch//eos/project/e/ecloud-simulations/YOURDIRECTORY/stability/LHC_chm_ver.mat
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
transfer_output_files = ""
request_cpus = 8
request_memory = 16GB
request_disk = 20GB
+JobFlavour = "tomorrow"
queue 1
```

Adjust CPU, memory, and disk requests to your simulation.
Passing `request_cpus` to the script makes PyPARIS use the allocated number
of processes. Simulation data travels to EOS from
the worker, so no simulation filenames appear in `transfer_output_files`.

## Worker script

Download {download}`pyparis_executable.sh <../_static/htcondor/pyparis_executable.sh>`
and save it beside `htcondor.sub`. Set `ROOT_URL`, `SIM_PATH`, and the environment
activation path. `SIM_PATH` must end in `/`. See
[Python environment](index.md#python-environment) for setup instructions.

This script follows the example in
`examples/HTCondor_templates/PyPARIS_singlebunch_checkpoint_job/`.

```{literalinclude} ../_static/htcondor/pyparis_executable.sh
:language: bash
```

### Checkpoint files

The same file set is downloaded on continuation and uploaded after each
completed part. `NN` is `present_simulation_part` formatted with at least two
digits (`00`, `01`, ...).

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `simulation_status.sta` | Part number and completion state; uploaded last |
| `bunch_status_partNN.h5` | Saved bunch state |
| `bunch_evolution_NN.h5`, `slice_evolution_NN.h5` | Evolution monitors for the part |
| `sim_param.pkl` | Saved simulation parameters |
| `pyparislog.txt` | Simulation log |
| `envinfo.txt`, `stdout.txt`, `stderr.txt` | Environment information and worker-captured Python output |
| `multigrid_config_dip.pkl`, `multigrid_config_dip.txt` | Optional saved dipole multigrid configuration, copied when present |

`Simulation_parameters.py` and `pyecloud_config` are fetched for every part.
Keep these inputs and the software environment consistent throughout the run.
The run directory must exist before the first job. A successful directory
listing without a status file means a fresh run; a failed listing aborts the
job. Never remove the status file to recover a failed continuation.

### Alternative: use the maintained container

Replace `run_python` with the [CVMFS container wrapper](index.md#alternative-a-cvmfs-container)
and remove the `source .../activate-ecloud.sh` line. The exact container path is:

```text
/cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/ghcr.io/ekatralis/ecloud-containers:latest/
```

Input and output transfers still run in the host worker shell. The environment
recording command will then capture the container's `ECLOUD_CONTAINER_VERSION`.

### Exit codes and checkpoint transfers

The script captures Python's exit code immediately. It uploads the checkpoint
on `0` or `177`, then returns that code. Input or output transfer failures return
`1`. Do not add an unguarded `set -e` around Python: `177` is expected and the
checkpoint must be uploaded before exiting.

The script checks the required files and transfer results, then uploads
`simulation_status.sta` last. Previous bunch states are retained.
An interrupted upload can leave files from different parts on EOS. Inspect
the checkpoint before restarting. Run only one workflow per EOS simulation
directory.

## DAGMan continuation

Save as `workflow.dag`:

```text
JOB simulation htcondor.sub
SCRIPT POST simulation post_check.sh $RETURN
RETRY simulation 999 UNLESS-EXIT 0
ABORT-DAG-ON simulation 11 RETURN 1
```

Save as `post_check.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
case "${1:-missing}" in
    0)   exit 0 ;;
    177) exit 177 ;;
    *)   exit 11 ;;
esac
```

The POST script runs on the submission side. It maps the worker return code
to a DAG decision: `0` completes the node, `177` requests another part, and
any other result becomes `11`, aborting the DAG. The retry count bounds the
number of additional parts; choose it to cover your planned run. See
[DAGMan retry and abort behavior](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/automated-workflows/dagman-advance-functionality.html).

```bash
mkdir -p logs
chmod +x pyparis_executable.sh post_check.sh
condor_submit -dry-run submit.ads htcondor.sub
condor_submit_dag workflow.dag
```

A job held during output transfer can delay the POST script and prevent
continuation. Inspect `condor_q -hold`, the scheduler event log, and the DAGMan
output when continuation stops. This workflow continues **completed parts**;
it does not automatically recover a worker killed mid-part. Resolve incomplete
state or transfer failures before restarting the workflow.
